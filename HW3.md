$L$ is regualr.

Proof:

$a, b \in ∑$,  $a, b$ are regular expression. 

So $a^*$ is r.e., $b^*$ is r.e.. 

Hence $a^*b^*$ is r.e. as well. 

For all word $w$ generated by $a^*b^*,$ $w = a^nb^m(m≥0, n ≥0)$ , $\Rightarrow w\in L$ .

For all word $v \in L$, $v = a^nb^m( n ≥0, m≥0$). $\Rightarrow w$ is generated by $a^*b^*$.

Hence $L$ = { $a^*b^*$}. 

So the following regular expression $a^*b^*$ corresponds to $L$. Since we can write a regular expression for $L$, and a DFA could be constructed as follow,

In conclusion, $L$ is regular.

$L$ is not regular.

Proof by contradiction.

Assume $L$ is a regular language. Then pumping lemma must hold. 

Let $p$ be the pumping length given by the Pumping lemma. $p ≥ 1$ depending only on $L$ such that every string $s $ in $L$ of length at least $p$.  Then $s \in L$ and $|s| ≥ p$. Pumping lemma guranantees $s $ can be split into 3 pieces,$s = xyz$, such that 

- $|y| ≥ 1$, 
- $|xy| ≤ h$  
- for any $i≥ 0$, $xy^iz \in L$.

Let $ s$ = $a^nb^mc^{2(n+m)}$ where $n > h$.

then $ s = a^pa^{n-p}b^mc^{2(n+m)}$ Where $xy = a^p$, $ z = a^{n-p}b^mc^{2(n+m)}$.

$\Rightarrow x = a^{p-q}, y = a^q, z = a^{n-p}b^mc^{2(n+m)} $since $|xy|≤h$.

By case 3 of pumping lemma, $xyyz \in L$.

$xyyz $ = $a^{p-q}a^{2q}a^{n-p}b^mc^{2(n+m)}=a^{p+q}b^mc^{2(n+m)}$ 

$\Rightarrow xyyz \notin L$. A contradiction. 

Due to the contradiction, the pumping lemma cannot be hold for $L$. Hence $L$ is not regular.
